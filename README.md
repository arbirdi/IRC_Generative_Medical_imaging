# IRC_Generative_Medical_imaging
Our project on Generative Medical Imaging for Interdisciplinary Research Computing 2023, Imperial College London.

This README file explains where to find different parts of our project within this GitHub Repository.

Our final product workflow is within /FINAL PRODUCTS. This includes our data loader 2d_load.py (written by Zijia), final GAN model Rewritten_2_2_120x120_DCGAN_final.ipynb (written by Aidan, based on Tensorflow Tutorial DCGAN), generator model data (Final_generator_model_h5.zip) and our visualising programmes Visualising_GAN_images_final.ipynb and Visualising_GAN_images_final_2.ipynb (both written by Aidan). The final outputs of the visualisation programmes are present as .png files and within our Group Poster.

A preliminary Weights and Biases folder /W&B GAN for an early GAN model was written by Zijia, based on an earlier GAN model written by Aidan.

Selected preliminary and prototype models are found within /Selected 120x120 GAN iterations (does not include final) , /Selected 60x60 GAN iteration . All models here were written by Aidan, largely based on Tensorflow Tutorial DCGAN. There are some checkpoints and early GAN model images within /Selected 120x120 GAN iterations (does not include final)/Images_13_03_23 and /Selected 120x120 GAN iterations (does not include final)/dcgan.gif. Such outputs however, were not applied to the final model for logistical and time constraint reasons, however we hope that these early results are nevertheless interesting to see.

/dcgan_google_tensorflow contains is Tensorflow's Tutorial GAN https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan , which provided a helpful structure to base our model on.

We have not uploaded the majority of input data here for file size constraint reasons (over 1GB) as well as data privacy reasons.

Our poster submission is within the main branch (Template_2.pptx - collaboratively written by Zijia, Aidan, Muzammil and Muyi), as well as our project proposal (IRC_final_project_proposal.pdf - collaboratively written by Zijia, Aidan, Muzammil and Muyi).

The GitHub Repo and this README were managed by Aidan.
